# DreamXV
DreamXV is a mobile platform application we created for Software Development Group Project in 2nd Year at IIT. <br>

DreamXV can be used as a DSS for team making in Rugby. for this application we used rugby players from six nations. user can view the best 15 players for each position from all the six countries. and also the user can view all the players for each position and their details. by using this application user can compare two players at a time. machine learning is used to recommend a new position for each player based on their statistics. therefore we can determine which position is suitable for each player<br>

## For this project we used following stack, <br>
FrontEnd - ReactNative <br>
Backend  - Python <br>
API      - Flask
